# Scry Skill

Scry gives you read-only SQL access to the ExoPriors public corpus
via a single HTTP endpoint. You write Postgres SQL against a curated `scry.*` schema
and get JSON rows back. There is no ORM, no GraphQL, no pagination token -- just SQL.
Use `GET /v1/stats` or `GET /v1/scry/context` for live corpus counts instead of relying on static numbers in docs.

**Skill generation**: `2026032902`

## A) When to use / not use

**Use this skill when:**
- Searching, filtering, or aggregating content across the ExoPriors corpus
- Running lexical (BM25) or hybrid searches
- Exploring author networks, cross-platform identities, or publication patterns
- Navigating the OpenAlex academic graph (authors, citations, institutions, concepts)
- Creating shareable artifacts from query results
- Emitting structured agent judgements about entities or external references

**Do NOT use this skill when:**
- The user wants semantic/vector search composition or embedding algebra
  (use the scry-vectors skill)
- The user wants LLM-based reranking (use the scry-rerank skill)
- The user is querying their own local database

## B) Golden Rules

1. **Context handshake first.** At session start, call
   `GET /v1/scry/context?skill_generation=2026032902`.
   This endpoint is public; you do not need a key for the handshake itself.
   Use the returned `offerings` block for the current product summary
   budgets, canonical env var, default skill, and specialized skill catalog.
   Read `offerings.portable_entry` as the canonical `/scry` flow:
   `context -> schema -> route -> query`.
   Read `offerings.search` as the typed first-pass search contract:
   browser `/search`, `POST /v1/scry/search`, and
   `GET /v1/scry/search/records/{record_ref}`.
   Read `offerings.payments` as the payment-role contract: it tells you which
   protocols are live vs planned, which ones fund the reusable prepaid ledger,
   which ones are hot-path query payment vs delegated authorization, and which
   authenticated control-plane endpoints expose reusable instruments and stored
   mandate artifacts.
   Read `offerings.accelerator_families` and
   `offerings.relation_accelerator_policies` as the accelerator contract:
   they tell you which relations are canonical defaults versus optional
   convenience helpers, which tracked objects gate them, and what fallback
   surfaces to use.
   If you need a concise shareable bootstrap prompt for another agent, use
   `offerings.public_agent_prompt.copy_text` instead of paraphrasing your own.
   If you need deeper docs, use `offerings.canonical_doc_path`, each skill's
   `repo_path`, and `reference_paths` instead of guessing where the maintained
   docs live.
   If you cache descriptive bootstrap context across turns or sessions, also
   track `surface_context_generation` and refresh when it changes.
   Read `lexical_search.status`, `lexical_search.status_basis`, and
   `lexical_search.last_known_status` as well. If `status_basis` is
   `observability_lag` and `last_known_status` is `healthy`, global
   `scry.search*` is still the default unless the task is recency-critical or
   results look wrong. Pivot to source-local `scry.*` / `mv_*` surfaces or
   semantic retrieval when the confirmed status is `rebuilding`, `degraded`,
   or `unavailable`, or when a stale snapshot's last known status is not
   healthy.
   If `should_update_skill=true`, tell the user to run `npx skills update`.
   If the response reports `client_skill_generation: null` while you're using
   packaged skills, or if local instructions still mention legacy ExoPriors
   hostnames or legacy console routes, treat the install as stale and ask
   the user to run `npx skills update` before more debugging.

2. **Schema first.** ALWAYS call `GET /v1/scry/schema` before writing SQL.
   Never guess column names or types. The schema endpoint returns live
   column metadata and row-count estimates for every view.

   If the task targets publication-first Parquet datasets rather than the live
   Scry SQL corpus, call `GET /v1/scry/datasets` and
   `POST /v1/scry/datasets/{id}/resolve` before writing SQL. The resolve
   response gives you short-lived DuckDB-ready HTTPS URLs and bootstrap SQL.

3. **Check operational status when search looks wrong.** If lexical search,
   materialized-view freshness, or corpus behavior seems off, call
   `GET /v1/scry/index-view-status` with any Scry key before assuming the query
   or schema is wrong. If `/v1/scry/context` marks a relation as `fast_path` or
   `conditional`, do not rely on it until the required tracked objects are
   healthy.

4. **Clarify ambiguous intent before heavy queries.** If the request is vague
   ("search Reddit for X", "find things about Y"), ask one short clarification
   question about the goal/output format before running expensive SQL.

5. **Start with a cheap probe.** Before any query likely to run >5s, run
   `GET /v1/scry/price` plus `/v1/scry/estimate` and/or a tight exploratory
   query (`LIMIT 20` plus scoped source/window filters), then scale only after
   confirming relevance. Use `GET /v1/scry/price/history` when you need to know
   whether the current base fee is a spike or the recent norm.

6. **Treat paid queries as budget-bounded.** For paid execution, Scry reserves
   nanodollar credits up front and derives a runtime timeout from the authorized
   spend envelope. The runtime enforces that envelope with a live-burn watchdog
   first and a timeout fallback second. Lead with the simplified surface:
   use `X-Scry-Budget` as the primary per-query cost control, `eager` and
   `patient` as the two execution modes, and `GET /v1/scry/account` as the
   one-stop status check before or after heavy work. Use `GET /v1/scry/pricing`
   plus `/v1/scry/estimate` when you need the live cost details behind that
   surface.
   When acting under a stored delegated mandate, also send
   `X-Scry-Subject-Agent: <agent-id>` so Scry can apply the matching
   `query_access` mandate cap.
   Under congestion, `eager` mode uses **uniform clearing**: winners pay the
   epoch clearing price, not their full submitted maximum. The account's stored
   `max_bid_multiplier` from `GET` / `PATCH /v1/scry/preferences` still caps the
   effective eager bid before admission. Agents that prefer to wait can switch
   `pricing_mode` to `patient`, which keeps FIFO ordering and runs at base
   price when capacity opens.
   Use the `payment_surface` block in `/v1/scry/pricing` to distinguish live
   direct query payment (`x402`) and live account-funding rails
   (`stripe_checkout`, `crypto_topup`) from control-plane / future artifacts
   (`stripe_acp`, `ap2`, `visa_tap`, `mastercard_agent_pay`).
   Read `payment_surface.card_funding` and
   `payment_surface.card_funding_read_order` before assuming cards are either
   fully blocked or fully API-native; the contract is a one-time setup handoff,
   then API-only saved-method funding.
   When delegated funding or agent authorization matters, inspect
   `GET /v1/billing/auto-topup`,
   `GET /v1/billing/payment-instruments`, and
   `GET /v1/billing/payment-mandates` rather than assuming those artifacts are
   hidden inside the query surface.
   backward-compat note: older clients may still use `X-Scry-Max-Cost`,
   `X-Scry-Max-Exposure`, `X-Scry-Bid`, or `pricing_mode: "dynamic" | "queue"`,
   but new integrations should lead with `X-Scry-Budget` and `eager` /
   `patient`.

7. **Choose typed search vs SQL vs semantic explicitly.** Use
   `POST /v1/scry/search` when the user wants fast provenance-bearing first
   results without writing SQL; follow returned identities with
   `GET /v1/scry/search/records/{record_ref}` for richer detail hydration.
   Use lexical SQL (`scry.search*`) for exact terms and named entities when you
   need joins, aggregation, or full control over filters. For conceptual intent
   ("themes", "things like", "similar to"), route to scry-vectors first, then
   optionally hybridize.

8. **LIMIT always.** Every query MUST include a LIMIT clause. Max 10,000 rows.
   Queries without LIMIT are rejected by the SQL validator.

9. **Prefer canonical surfaces with tight filters.** `scry.entities` is large
   enough that you should not scan it blindly. Use `scry.search*` for lexical retrieval,
   `scry.chunk_embeddings` for chunk-level semantic retrieval, `scry.entity_embeddings`
   or `scry.entities_with_embeddings` only when you want one entity-level vector
   row per entity, `scry.embedding_coverage` to inspect public vs staged vs ready
   source/kind coverage, source-local `scry.*_embeddings` views when you need
   the exact semantic owner table, and source-native tables or aliases such as
   `scry.hackernews`, `scry.wikipedia`, `scry.pubmed`, `scry.repec`,
   `scry.kalshi`, `scry.nih_reporter`, `scry.govinfo_crec`,
   `scry.offshoreleaks`, `scry.openalex`, `scry.bluesky`,
   `scry.huggingface`, `scry.huggingface_papers`,
   `scry.huggingface_collections`, `scry.huggingface_discussions`,
   `scry.huggingface_accounts`, `scry.huggingface_models`,
   `scry.huggingface_datasets`, `scry.huggingface_spaces`,
   `scry.huggingface_repo_text_artifacts`,
   `scry.kalshi_markets`, `scry.nih_reporter_projects`,
   `scry.govinfo_crec_granules`, `scry.hackernews_items`,
   `scry.wikipedia_articles`, `scry.pubmed_papers`, `scry.repec_records`,
   `scry.openalex_works`, `scry.bluesky_posts`, `scry.mailing_list_messages`,
   `scry.openlibrary_*`, `scry.stackexchange`, `scry.caselaw`,
   `scry.gutenberg_books`, `scry.wikidata_items`, `scry.wikidata_claims`,
   and `scry.kl3m` when a corpus no longer lives canonically in
   `scry.entities`. Reach for a specific `mv_*` convenience view only when
   `/v1/scry/schema` confirms it is healthy and useful for the task.

   For Hugging Face specifically, prefer `scry.search_huggingface()` when you
   need one discovery-first entry point across repos, artifacts, papers,
   collections, discussions, accounts, and paper-artifact hops.

10. **Cross-table composition is normal.** If the best records live in multiple
   source-native tables, combine them in one SQL statement with CTEs,
   `UNION ALL`, and joins through `scry.source_records`. This is the intended
   contract, not a workaround.

11. **Filter dangerous content.** On `scry.entities`,
   `scry.entities_with_embeddings`, and `scry.chunk_embeddings`, include
   `WHERE content_risk IS DISTINCT FROM 'dangerous'` unless the user explicitly
   asks for unfiltered results. If a source-native view does not expose
   `content_risk`, join it to `scry.entities` on `entity_id` and filter there.
   Dangerous content contains adversarial prompt-injection content.

12. **Raw SQL, not JSON.** `POST /v1/scry/query` takes `Content-Type: text/plain`
   with raw SQL in the body. Not JSON-wrapped SQL.

13. **File rough edges promptly.** If Scry blocks the task, misses an obvious
   result set, or exposes a rough edge, submit a brief note to
   `POST /v1/feedback?feedback_type=suggestion|bug|other&channel=scry_skill`
   using `Content-Type: text/plain` by default (`text/markdown` also works). Do not silently work
   around it. Logged-in users can review their submissions with `GET /v1/feedback`.

For full tier limits, timeout policies, and degradation strategies, see [Shared Guardrails](../references/guardrails.md).

### B.1 API Key Setup (Canonical)

Recommended default for less-technical users: in the directory where you launch the agent, store `SCRY_API_KEY` in `.env` so skills and copied prompts use the same place.
Canonical key naming for this skill:
- Env var: `SCRY_API_KEY`
- Anonymous bootstrap key format: `scry_anon_*` from `POST /v1/scry/anonymous-key`
- Personal key format: personal Scry API key with Scry access
- Recommended anonymous client header: `X-Scry-Client-Tag: <short-stable-tag>`

Durable machine bootstrap paths:
1. **Operator-provisioned** (default for non-wallet agents): a signed-in human operator calls `POST /v1/auth/api-keys`, creates a Scry-scoped key, hands the secret to the agent, and the agent stores it in `SCRY_API_KEY`.
2. **Wallet-native**: `POST /v1/auth/agent/signup` for agents that already have an EVM wallet; the response returns a session token plus API key.

Both paths end with the same `Authorization: Bearer $SCRY_API_KEY` contract.

```bash
printf '%s\n' 'SCRY_API_KEY=<your key>' >> .env
set -a && source .env && set +a
```

Verify:
```bash
echo "$SCRY_API_KEY"
```

Anonymous bootstrap flow when the user wants immediate public access without signup:
```bash
CLIENT_TAG="${SCRY_CLIENT_TAG:-dev-laptop}"
ANON_KEY="$(curl -s https://api.scry.io/v1/scry/anonymous-key -X POST -H "X-Scry-Client-Tag: $CLIENT_TAG" | python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)[\"api_key\"])')"
curl -s https://api.scry.io/v1/scry/schema \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ANON_KEY" \
  -H "X-Scry-Client-Tag: $CLIENT_TAG"
curl -s https://api.scry.io/v1/scry/query \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ANON_KEY" \
  -H "X-Scry-Client-Tag: $CLIENT_TAG" \
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  --data "SELECT 1 LIMIT 1"
```
Use this for fast trial access only. The anonymous bootstrap lane is intentionally generous for the first few queries and then degrades. For sustained usage, prefer a personal Scry API key.
Keep the same `X-Scry-Client-Tag` value on the same device when staying anonymous so the backend can distinguish a real first-use session from abuse behind shared IPs.
The same anonymous key can also call `POST /v1/scry/embed`, `GET /v1/scry/vectors`, and `DELETE /v1/scry/vectors/{name}`. Those handles stay bound to the current anonymous session rather than a durable account namespace.

If using packaged skills, keep them current:
```bash
npx skills add exopriors/skills
npx skills update
```

### B.1a Fast typed search (non-SQL front door)

Use the typed search surface when the user wants fast first-pass discovery,
provenance-bearing result cards, or record-detail hydration without writing
SQL first.

```bash
curl -s https://api.scry.io/v1/scry/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"mechanistic interpretability","phase":"blink","limit":5}'
```

That response returns stable `record_ref` values plus provenance fields,
timings, and optional focus metadata. Hydrate one result with:

```bash
curl -s "https://api.scry.io/v1/scry/search/records/arxiv:2301.12345v2"
```

Use `/v1/scry/search` for quick discovery and `/search` handoff; switch to
`/v1/scry/query` when you need joins, aggregation, or exact SQL control.

### B.1b x402 Query-Only Access

`POST /v1/scry/query` still supports standard x402, but it is now an explicit
paid path rather than the default no-auth bootstrap path. Use x402 when the
user already has an x402-capable client or wallet and only wants direct paid query
execution. For public trial use, use `POST /v1/scry/anonymous-key`. For
schema/context, shares, judgements, feedback, or repeated multi-endpoint usage,
prefer a personal Scry API key.

The x402 flow is challenge-first. If x402 is enabled and the request has no
`Authorization` header, the first unsigned `POST /v1/scry/query` returns
`402 Payment Required` with machine-readable payment requirements. When the
caller also sends `X-Scry-Budget`, Scry asks the wallet to fund at least that
budget (subject to the configured x402 base quantum). After settlement,
the paid amount converts into reusable Scry credits on the shared ledger, so
overpayment remains available for later queries instead of being lost.

If the agent already has an EVM wallet and wants wallet-native durable identity
plus a reusable key, use `POST /v1/auth/agent/signup` first. If it does not
have a wallet, have a signed-in operator create a Scry-scoped key via
`POST /v1/auth/api-keys` and hand it to the agent. Both paths end with the same
Bearer-key contract.

Minimal client shape:

```js
import { wrapFetchWithPayment } from 'x402-fetch';

const paidFetch = wrapFetchWithPayment(fetch, walletClient);
const resp = await paidFetch('https://api.scry.io/v1/scry/query', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'content-type': 'text/plain' },
  body: 'SELECT 1 LIMIT 1',
});
```

### B.1c Query Budgeting

For paid queries, these are the key billing controls:

- `X-Scry-Budget: <nanodollars>` is the primary per-query cost control. Send it
  on `/v1/scry/estimate` and `/v1/scry/query` when you want one number to bound
  the estimate check, runtime authorization, and eager-mode bid cap.
- `GET /v1/scry/account` is the one-stop billing status check. It returns
  balance, current mode, max budget, today's spend/query count, live base fee,
  live utilization, and whether auto-topup is enabled.
- `GET /v1/scry/preferences` returns the caller's persisted
  `pricing_mode` (`eager` or `patient`) and `max_bid_multiplier`.
- `PATCH /v1/scry/preferences` updates `pricing_mode` and `max_bid_multiplier`.
  Use `pricing_mode: "patient"` when the user wants FIFO waiting at base price
  during congestion instead of bidding into the eager auction.
- `GET /v1/scry/price` returns the live `base_fee`, `utilization`, `load_stage`,
  `recommended_max_fee`, and current epoch metadata. Use it right before
  deciding whether to run now in `eager` mode or wait in `patient`.
- `GET /v1/scry/price/history` returns sampled `epoch_id` / `timestamp` /
  `base_fee` / `utilization` history plus sampling metadata for large windows.
- `GET /v1/scry/price/stream` returns an SSE feed with `price` events at epoch
  cadence and `ping` keepalives while no new epoch arrives.
- `GET /v1/scry/spend` returns the authenticated caller's own spend history:
  `total_credits_spent`, `query_count`, `avg_cost_per_query`, and recent
  per-query cost breakdowns.
- `GET /v1/scry/pricing` returns the live compute rate, bandwidth rate, load multiplier, reservation headroom, bid thresholds, the congestion-admission auction contract, and the budget-enforcement contract.
- `GET /v1/scry/pricing` also exposes the x402 base funding quantum and the fact that x402 funding now scales off `X-Scry-Budget` when that header is present.
- `GET /v1/scry/account` returns the authenticated funding summary. Read `funding.card_funding` first when the question is "can this agent use cards right now?" because it makes the current card state explicit (`requires_operator_setup`, `saved_method_ready`, `auto_topup_attention_required`, `auto_topup_active`, or `disabled`) and lists the next endpoints to call.
- `POST /v1/scry/estimate` returns `estimated_cost_nanodollars`, `suggested_reserve_nanodollars`, `authorized_exposure_nanodollars`, `exposure_timeout_ms`, and a bid-adjusted upper-bound `cost_breakdown`.
- `POST /v1/scry/query?receipt=summary` or `?receipt=full` returns an optional execution receipt inline with the result. Use `summary` when you only need the stable ID, SQL fingerprint, and main cost/runtime facts; use `full` when you want the estimate, billing, execution, and structured security details in one object.
- `GET /v1/scry/query-receipts/{id}` re-hydrates the durable query receipt for the authenticated caller from `scry_query_log`. Raw SQL is omitted by default; add `?include_sql=true` when the owner explicitly needs the original statement back.
- `X-Scry-Subject-Agent: <agent-id>` activates delegated query policy. If the authenticated account has a matching active `query_access` mandate, Scry applies that mandate's `max_query_exposure` as an additional cap and returns a `delegated_authorization` object. If not, `/v1/scry/query` fails with `delegated_authorization_required`.
  - Cards are a two-stage rail, not a zero-setup hot path.
  - `POST /v1/billing/setup-payment-method` creates a Stripe Checkout setup session that saves a card without charging it and returns `setup_url` for one operator browser visit. After completion, the card is persisted as a payment instrument and set as the default. This is the entry point for enabling Stripe-backed auto-topup and agent-topup.
- `POST /v1/billing/agent-topup` charges the default stored payment instrument for a pricing tier amount, granting credits immediately. Designed for agent-initiated funding without browser interaction and requires only a saved payment method.
- Recurring Stripe rescue is a separate opt-in that requires an active auto_topup mandate via `POST /v1/billing/payment-mandates` plus `PATCH /v1/billing/auto-topup`.
- `GET /v1/billing/auto-topup` and `PATCH /v1/billing/auto-topup` control Stripe-backed replenishment into the same prepaid ledger. If enabled with a verified default Stripe payment method plus an active `auto_topup` mandate, `/v1/scry/query` gets one off-session topup attempt after an `insufficient_credits` reservation failure and then retries reservation once.
- `GET /v1/billing/auto-topup/eligibility` explains why recurring saved-method funding is not yet ready when `funding.card_funding.state` reports `auto_topup_attention_required`.
- `GET /v1/billing/pricing` returns available credit pricing tiers with id, usd_cents, credits (nanodollars), and display_label.
- `GET /v1/billing/payment-instruments` lists saved payment methods.
- Live funding rails are `x402`, Stripe saved-method funding, and crypto topup. `stripe_acp`, `ap2`, `visa_tap`, and `mastercard_agent_pay` are control-plane / future artifact layers, not interchangeable live funding rails.
- In `eager` mode, uniform clearing means the charged priority fee comes from
  the lowest winning bid in the epoch, not from every winner's submitted max
  bid.
- `max_bid_multiplier` clamps the effective eager bid before the request enters
  the auction.
- Billable bandwidth uses the executor-tracked streamed row payload bytes, not the outer HTTP/JSON envelope. Full response-body size still matters for delivery limits and alerts.
- backward-compat note: legacy clients may still send `X-Scry-Max-Cost`,
  `X-Scry-Max-Exposure`, `X-Scry-Bid`, or `pricing_mode: "dynamic" | "queue"`.
  New integrations should lead with `X-Scry-Budget`, `eager`, `patient`, and
  `GET /v1/scry/account`.

Useful response headers from `POST /v1/scry/query`:

- `x-scry-cost`: charged nanodollars for the completed query
- `x-scry-receipt-id`: stable execution-receipt id when receipt mode is enabled
- `x-scry-authorized-exposure`: the hard exposure authorization applied to this run
- `x-scry-reserved`: the reserved/pre-authorized nanodollar amount
- `x-scry-exposure-timeout-ms`: exposure-derived runtime cutoff
- `x-scry-bid-accepted` / `x-scry-bid-charged`: submitted max bid vs clearing-price multiplier actually charged
- `x-scry-admission` / `x-scry-admission-wait-ms`: whether the request started immediately or through a congestion epoch, plus the admission wait
- `X-Scry-Base-Fee`: current epoch base-fee multiplier used to price compute
- `X-Scry-Priority-Fee`: congestion premium implied by the accepted clearing price
- `X-Scry-Compute-Units`: normalized compute units charged for the query
- `X-Scry-Utilization`: price-epoch utilization snapshot
- `X-Scry-Epoch`: current price epoch id
- `X-Scry-Budget-Remaining`: credits or free-tier budget remaining after settlement

If a paid query runs into its spend envelope, the API returns `402` with
`query_exposure_exhausted`. That is enforced by live runtime burn first, with
the exposure timeout as fallback. The fix is to narrow the query or raise
`X-Scry-Budget`, not to keep retrying the same request unchanged.

```

## D) Decision Tree

```
User wants to search the ExoPriors corpus?
  |
  +-- Ambiguous / conceptual ask? --> Clarify intent first, then use
  |     scry-vectors for semantic search (optionally hybridize with lexical)
  |
  +-- By keywords/phrases? --> scry.search() (BM25 lexical over canonical content_text)
  |     +-- Specific forum?  --> join/filter `source` explicitly (or use a healthy source-local view if schema confirms it)
  |     +-- Reddit?          --> START with scry.reddit_subreddit_stats /
  |                              scry.reddit_clusters() / scry.reddit_embeddings
  |                              and trust /v1/scry/schema status before

## E) Recipes

### E0. Context handshake + skill update advisory

```bash
curl -s "https://api.scry.io/v1/scry/context?skill_generation=2026032902" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SCRY_API_KEY"
```

If response includes `"should_update_skill": true`, ask the user to run:
`npx skills update`.
If the response shows `"client_skill_generation": null` while the session is
using packaged Scry skills, or if local instructions still point at
legacy ExoPriors hostnames or legacy console routes, stop and ask the user
to run `npx skills update` before deeper debugging.
If response includes `"lexical_search": {...}`, read `status`, `status_basis`,
and `last_known_status` together. When `status = "stale"` and
`status_basis = "observability_lag"` with `last_known_status = "healthy"`,
global lexical search is still the default unless the task is recency-critical
or the results look wrong. Prefer source-local `scry.*` surfaces or
`scry.entities_with_embeddings` when the confirmed status is `rebuilding`,
`degraded`, or `unavailable`, or when a stale snapshot's last known status is
not healthy. Use `/v1/scry/index-view-status` for detailed live timing before
blaming the query.

### E0b. Submit feedback when Scry blocks the task

```bash
curl -s "https://api.scry.io/v1/feedback?feedback_type=bug&channel=scry_skill" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SCRY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  --data $'## What happened\n- Query: ...\n- Problem: ...\n\n## Why it matters\n- ...\n\n## Suggested fix\n- ...'
```

Success response includes a receipt `id`. Logged-in users can review their own
submissions with:

```bash
curl -s "https://api.scry.io/v1/feedback?limit=10" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SCRY_API_KEY"
```

### E1. Lexical search (BM25)

```sql
WITH c AS (
  SELECT id FROM scry.search('your query here',
    kinds=>ARRAY['post'], limit_n=>100)
)
SELECT e.uri, e.title, e.original_author, e.original_timestamp
FROM c JOIN scry.entities e ON e.id = c.id
WHERE e.content_risk IS DISTINCT FROM 'dangerous'
LIMIT 50
```

Default `kinds` if omitted: `['post','paper','document','webpage','twitter_thread','grant']`.
`scry.search()` broadens once to `kinds=>ARRAY['comment']` if that default returns 0 rows.
Pass explicit `kinds` for strict scope (for example comment-only or tweet-only).
For source scoping, join back to `scry.entities` and filter `source` explicitly.
Healthy source-specific MVs can still be useful for source-native score fields
such as `base_score`, but they are optional convenience slices rather than the default path.

### E2. Reddit-specific discovery

```sql
SELECT subreddit, total_count, latest
FROM scry.reddit_subreddit_stats
WHERE subreddit IN ('MachineLearning', 'LocalLLaMA')
ORDER BY total_count DESC
```

For semantic Reddit retrieval over the embedding-covered subset, use
`scry.reddit_embeddings` or `scry.search_reddit_posts_semantic(...)`.

Direct retrieval helpers (`scry.reddit_posts`, `scry.reddit_comments`,
`scry.mv_reddit_*`, `scry.search_reddit_posts(...)`,
`scry.search_reddit_comments(...)`) are currently degraded on the public
instance. Check `/v1/scry/schema` status before using them.

### E3. Source-filtered materialized view query

```sql
SELECT entity_id, uri, title, original_author, score, original_timestamp
FROM scry.arxiv_papers
WHERE original_timestamp >= '2025-01-01'
ORDER BY original_timestamp DESC
LIMIT 50
```

`score` is not the useful ranking axis for arXiv. Sort by
`original_timestamp`, `primary_category`, or downstream citation proxies instead.

### E4. Author activity across sources

```sql
SELECT e.source::text, COUNT(*) AS docs, MAX(e.original_timestamp) AS latest
FROM scry.entities e
WHERE e.original_author ILIKE '%yudkowsky%'
  AND e.content_risk IS DISTINCT FROM 'dangerous'
GROUP BY e.source::text
ORDER BY docs DESC
LIMIT 20
```

### E5. Recent entity kind distribution for a source

```sql
SELECT kind::text, COUNT(*)
FROM scry.hackernews_items
WHERE original_timestamp >= '2025-01-01'
GROUP BY kind::text
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 20
```

Source-native corpora follow the same pattern:

```sql
SELECT kind::text, COUNT(*)
FROM scry.wikipedia_articles
WHERE original_timestamp >= '2025-01-01'
GROUP BY kind::text
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 20
```

Removing the date bound turns this into a large base-table aggregation. Run
`/v1/scry/estimate` first or prefer source-specific MVs when they already cover
the question.

### E6. Hybrid search (lexical + semantic rerank in SQL)

```sql
WITH c AS (
  SELECT id FROM scry.search('deceptive alignment',
    kinds=>ARRAY['post'], limit_n=>200)
)
SELECT e.uri, e.title, e.original_author,
       emb.embedding_voyage4 <=> @p_deadbeef_topic AS distance
FROM c
JOIN scry.entities e ON e.id = c.id
JOIN scry.chunk_embeddings emb ON emb.entity_id = c.id AND emb.chunk_index = 0
WHERE e.content_risk IS DISTINCT FROM 'dangerous'
ORDER BY distance
LIMIT 50
```

Requires a stored embedding handle (`@p_deadbeef_topic`). See scry-vectors
skill for creating handles.

### E7. Cost estimation before execution

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://api.scry.io/v1/scry/estimate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SCRY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"sql": "SELECT arxiv_id, title FROM scry.arxiv_papers LIMIT 1000"}'
```

Returns EXPLAIN (FORMAT JSON) output. Use this for expensive queries before committing.
It does not prove BM25 helper health: if `scry.search*` fails, check
`/v1/scry/index-view-status` and `/v1/scry/schema` status as well.
The `/v1/scry/context` handshake now also exposes `lexical_search.status`,
`status_basis`, and `last_known_status` so you can distinguish stale
observability from confirmed lexical trouble before issuing fallbacks.

### E8. Create a shareable artifact

```bash
# 1. Run query and capture results
# 2. POST share
curl -s -X POST https://api.scry.io/v1/scry/shares \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SCRY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "kind": "query",
    "title": "Top RLHF posts on LessWrong",
    "summary": "20 highest-scored LW posts mentioning RLHF.",
    "payload": {
      "sql": "...",
      "result": {"columns": [...], "rows": [...]}
    }
  }'
```

Kinds: `query`, `rerank`, `insight`, `chat`, `markdown`.
Progressive update: create stub immediately, then `PATCH /v1/scry/shares/{slug}`.
Rendered at: `https://scry.io/scry/share/{slug}`.

### E9. Emit a structured agent judgement

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://api.scry.io/v1/scry/judgements \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SCRY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "emitter": "my-agent",
    "judgement_kind": "topic_classification",
    "target_external_ref": "arxiv:2401.12345",
    "summary": "Paper primarily about mechanistic interpretability.",
    "payload": {"primary_topic": "mech_interp", "confidence_detail": "title+abstract match"},
    "confidence": 0.88,
    "tags": ["arxiv", "mech_interp"],
    "privacy_level": "self"
  }'
```

Exactly one target required: `target_entity_id`, `target_actor_id`,
`target_judgement_id`, or `target_external_ref`.
Public judgements must target `target_entity_id`, `target_actor_id`, or
`target_judgement_id`; `target_external_ref` is limited to `self` or `group`
privacy.
Judgement-on-judgement: use `target_judgement_id` to chain observations.

### E10. People / author lookup

```sql
-- Per-source author grouping
SELECT a.handle, a.display_name, a.source::text, COUNT(*) AS docs
FROM scry.entities e
JOIN scry.actors a ON a.id = e.author_actor_id
WHERE e.source = 'twitter'
GROUP BY a.handle, a.display_name, a.source::text
ORDER BY docs DESC
LIMIT 50
```

### E11. Thread navigation (replies)

```sql
-- Find all replies to a root post
SELECT id, uri, title, original_author, original_timestamp
FROM scry.entities
WHERE anchor_entity_id = 'ROOT_ENTITY_UUID'
ORDER BY original_timestamp
LIMIT 100
```

`anchor_entity_id` is the root subject; `parent_entity_id` is the direct parent.

### E12. Count estimation (safe pattern)

Avoid `COUNT(*)` on large tables. Instead, use schema endpoint row estimates or:

```sql
SELECT reltuples::bigint AS estimated_rows
FROM pg_class
WHERE relname = 'mv_lesswrong_posts'
LIMIT 1
```

Note: `pg_class` access is blocked on the public Scry SQL surface. Use `/v1/scry/schema` instead.

## F) Error Handling

See `references/error-reference.md` for the full catalogue. Key patterns:

| HTTP | Code | Meaning | Action |
|------|------|---------|--------|
| 400 | `invalid_request` | SQL parse error, missing LIMIT, bad params | Fix query |
| 401 | `unauthorized` | Missing or invalid API key | Check key |
| 402 | `insufficient_credits` | Token budget exhausted | Notify user |
| 429 | `rate_limited` | Too many requests | Respect `Retry-After` header |
| 503 | `service_unavailable` | Scry pool down or overloaded | Wait and retry |

**Auth + timeout diagnostics for CLI users:**
1. If curl shows HTTP `000`, that is client-side timeout/network abort, not a server HTTP status. Check `--max-time` and retry with `/v1/scry/estimate` first.
2. If you see `401` with `"Invalid authorization format"`, check for whitespace/newlines in the key:
   `KEY_CLEAN="$(printf '%s' \"$SCRY_API_KEY\" | tr -d '\\r\\n')"`
   then use `Authorization: Bearer $KEY_CLEAN`.

**Quota fallback strategy:**
1. If 429: wait `Retry-After` seconds, retry once.
2. If 402: tell the user their token budget is exhausted.
3. If 503: retry after 30s with exponential backoff (max 3 attempts).
4. If query times out: simplify (use MV instead of full table, reduce LIMIT,
   add tighter WHERE filters).

## G) Output Contract

When this skill completes a query task, return a consistent structure:

```
## Scry Result

**Query**: <natural language description>
**SQL**: ```sql <the SQL that ran> ```
**Rows returned**: <N> (truncated: <yes/no>)
**Duration**: <N>ms

<formatted results table or summary>

**Share**: <share URL if created>
**Caveats**: <any data quality notes, e.g., "score is NULL for arXiv">
```

## Handoff Contract

**Produces:** JSON with `columns`, `rows`, `row_count`, `duration_ms`, `truncated`
**Feeds into:**
- `rerank`: ensure SQL returns `id` and `content_text` columns for candidate sets
- `scry-vectors`: save entity IDs for embedding lookup and semantic reranking
**Receives from:** none (entry point for SQL-based corpus access)
